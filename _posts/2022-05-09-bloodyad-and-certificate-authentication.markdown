A few days ago I read a [great article](https://offsec.almond.consulting/authenticating-with-certificates-when-pkinit-is-not-supported.html) from Yannick MÃ©heut of Almond about certificate authentication in Active Directory environment. It is especially useful when PKINIT is not supported and thus you can't use your certificate to request a TGT.
This is why I wanted to extend the capabilities of [bloodyAD](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD) by allowing certificate authentication.
Here is an example on how to use it (the first part show how to get a certificate if you just want to try the functionality):
{% highlight powershell %}
# Grab the cert

## Get the CA Authority name
## -debug is required in my env or it doesn't work
(venv) PS > certipy.exe find bloody/Administrator:passw0rd@192.168.10.2 -debug
Certipy v2.0.9 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)
