Discover our new solution **Secure Workspace** to keep your digital workspace secured in a few steps.

This solution based on Microsoft‚Ñ¢ technologies will allow you to manage your IT security in a few steps so you can focus on your business.\
<ins>No third-party required!</ins>

## Key Features
**Secure Workspace** takes the following into account:
- <ins>Digital Identity Management</ins>:\
A single account to rule them all! (Valid for all Microsoft‚Ñ¢ products, Windows Included)\
The **Secure Workspace** lets you choose strong authentication tailored to your business (password, biometrics, one-time code, etc). A suspicious connection? We block it! A change of employee? The old employee's account is replaced by the new one in just a few clicks.
- <ins>Secure management of workstations</ins>:\
Secure your devices (PCs and smartphones) by reinforcing security policy in a uniform and centralized way. Software and updates are pushed simultaneously across the entire fleet and next-generation anti-virus Microsoft Defender for Business analyzes suspicious behavior between different company devices to identify attacks.\

- <ins>Data leakage protection</ins>:\
To help you with your compliance policy for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the **Secure Workspace** implements a simple and secure data classification. Data is classified automatically and/or manually and a data security policy is assigned to it. E.g. documents classified as "internal" will not be able to leak out of the company network without you being alerted.
