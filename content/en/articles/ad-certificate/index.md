A few days ago I read a [great article](https://offsec.almond.consulting/authenticating-with-certificates-when-pkinit-is-not-supported.html) from Yannick MÃ©heut of Almond about certificate authentication in Active Directory environment. It is especially useful when PKINIT is not supported and thus you can't use your certificate to request a TGT.
This is why I wanted to extend the capabilities of [bloodyAD](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD) by allowing certificate authentication.
Here is an example on how to use it (the first part show how to get a certificate if you just want to try the functionality):

```ps1
# Grab the cert
## Get the CA Authority name
$ certipy find -u Administrator@bloody -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip 192.168.10.2 -debug
Certipy v4.0.0 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

## Get the PFX
$ certipy req -u Administrator@bloody.local -p 'Password123!' -target 192.168.10.2 -ca bloody-DC01-CA -template User
Certipy v4.0.0 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Requesting certificate via RPC
[*] Successfully requested certificate
[*] Request ID is 4
[*] Got certificate with UPN 'Administrator@bloody.local'
[*] Certificate has no object SID
[*] Saved certificate and private key to 'administrator.pfx'

## Convert it to pem
$ openssl pkcs12 -in administrator.pfx -out administrator.pem -nodes
Enter Import Password:

# Use cert authentication
$ bloodyAD -c ":administrator.pem" -d bloody -u Administrator --host 192.168.10.2 get object 'DC=bloody,DC=local' --attr msDS-Behavior-Version

distinguishedName: DC=bloody,DC=local
msDS-Behavior-Version: DS_BEHAVIOR_WIN2016
```

### Old certipy version v2.0.9

```ps1
# Grab the cert

## Get the CA Authority name
## -debug is required in my env or it doesn't work
(venv) PS > certipy.exe find bloody/Administrator:passw0rd@192.168.10.2 -debug
