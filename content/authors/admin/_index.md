## Who are we?
I am Baptiste Crépin, CEO and security expert at CravateRouge Ltd.

I began my journey into cybersecurity with a Master's degree from [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.shanghairanking.com/institution/paris-saclay-university). Following this, I gained extensive experience as a red team operator at [AXA Insurance](https://www.axa.com/en/about-us/axa-worldwide) specializing in Microsoft environments. This role gave me the opportunity to simulate real-world attacks to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

In addition, I share my research and develop advanced tools helping security experts to provide you cutting-edge protection. In particular, I had the honor of presenting one of my tool at the [Black Hat of Las Vegas](https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/arsenal/schedule/#bloodyad-26883), one of the largest computer security events in the world.

That's why I decided to found CravateRouge Ltd, to bring my expertise directly to you. With personalized, comprehensive cybersecurity services specialized in Microsoft products, we ensure your digital assets are protected by the best in the field. Trust in our expertise to safeguard your future.
